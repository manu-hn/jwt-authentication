1. Created API's using Node.js and Express.js
2. There are 3 APIs One for Registering, One for Login and Last one is For update
3. Here JWT Token Authentication has been done for verifying use, when the user is logged in then only he can update his details.
4. For Frontend I've used React.js library
5. To integrate frontend and backend I've used cors library
6. Not much concentrated on styling part and concentrated on functionalities mainly.

The flow of Work
1. First yo need to register
2. And the you have to login with the credentials you provided while registering.
3. If you are not logged in you cannot update / access the account.
4. Once you logged in JWT token has been created and stored in local-storage.
5. It's then used to authenticate the user
